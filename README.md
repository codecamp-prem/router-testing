# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# Project

- Advance Routing TESTing in React
- 90% of Real world work like CRUD operations, managing components, layouts, pages in React or any other web dev work
- The goal of this project is to practice testing a larger scale project with routing and API requests.
- Should never call real API While testing
- The code for this project is nearly identical to the code for our advanced blog project.
- Mock the API we use for this project as well.
  1. Test that the filtering on the `PostList` page works as expected.
     This will require quite a bit or API mocking, and is a rather large test. Make sure you test that it works with no filter, as well as that each of the filter fields work.
  2. Test that the `NewPost` page works when creating a post. This again will require lots of API mocking, and will even deal with navigating to new pages.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```
